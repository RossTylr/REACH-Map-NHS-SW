    "### 02b_matrix_coverage_fast_ops — end-to-end, sparse-matrix engine \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook purpose (plain language)**  \n",
    "This notebook swaps the *engine* that finds minimum times in `02a_coverage`.  \n",
    "Instead of pandas group-bys on the long travel table, we build two *sparse* matrices and use fast, vectorised reductions. All inputs, thresholds, blue-light factors, KPIs, and maps stay the same—only the internals get faster and more scalable, enabling instant “what-if” scenarios.\n",

    "#### What this notebook does\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Builds matrices (reshape only, no routing):**  \n",
    "  - **R** (response): rows = demand LSOAs, cols = station LSOAs, values = minutes station→LSOA.  \n",
    "  - **C** (conveyance): rows = demand LSOAs, cols = acute LSOAs, values = minutes LSOA→acute.\n",
    "- **Computes nearest times (vectorised, no loops):**  \n",
    "  - `t_resp = rowwise_min(R[:, active_stations])`  \n",
    "  - `t_conv = rowwise_min(C[:, active_acutes])`\n",
    "- **Applies business rules:** blue-light factors applied *after* minima (per-leg), thresholds as in 02a.\n",
    "- **Outputs unchanged:** coverage KPIs (% pop within 7/15 and 18/40), binary coverage columns, maps.\n",
    "- **Adds optional diagnostic:** `t_total = t_resp + on_scene_buffer + t_conv` (three-leg view).\n",
    "- **Enables scenarios:** select different station sets by column subset—no re-grouping or re-reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs (same as 02a)\n",
    "\n",
    "- LSOA universe (`lsoa_index`), centroids, populations (+ optional IMD / rural-urban).  \n",
    "- Station & acute site files resolved to LSOA codes.  \n",
    "- Long-form travel-time table already in the repo (response & conveyance legs).  \n",
    "- Thresholds & blue-light factors (ARP, handover, conveyance) defined up front.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- KPIs for response & conveyance at configured thresholds (overall and, optionally, by IMD/rural-urban).  \n",
    "- Binary coverage columns per threshold for mapping.  \n",
    "- (Optional) End-to-end time columns for transparency in pathway discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance & storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparse CSR** matrices for R and C; optional “has-edge” masks to distinguish true zeros from missing pairs.  \n",
    "- **Radius thinning** (e.g., drop times > 60 min) to shrink matrices without losing feasible options.  \n",
    "- **Caching:** save matrices + ordered labels to `data/.../matrices/*.npz` for instant reloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario selector\n",
    "\n",
    "Define scenarios as sets of active station/acute columns (e.g., `baseline`, `baseline + Site X`).  \n",
    "Switching scenario = re-taking per-row minima → near-instant “what-if” diffs and coverage deltas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation (first run)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parity check vs 02a:** times and KPIs should match within tight tolerance on the Cornwall slice.  \n",
    "- After validation, retire the legacy `min_time_from_any_origin` calls in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes & cautions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any change to travel-time inputs **invalidates caches** → rebuild matrices.  \n",
    "- LSOAs with no reachable station/acute remain at **∞** and are reported explicitly.  \n",
    "- Keep LSOA codes categorical and ordering stable to avoid misalignment bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
