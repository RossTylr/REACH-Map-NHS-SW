    "### 02c_MCLP_and_p-median — Optimal facility siting on sparse travel matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on **02b_matrix_coverage_fast_ops** to **choose station locations** that best serve demand under travel-time constraints. We solve two classic models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MCLP (Maximal Covering Location Problem):** place `p` stations to **maximise population covered** within a response-time threshold `T` (ARP-aligned bands: 7 / 15 / 18 / 40 min).\n",
    "- **p-median:** place `p` stations to **minimise population-weighted travel time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models re-use 02b’s cached sparse matrices (**R**, **R_mask**) for speed and reproducibility, and export clean tables/layers for maps, dashboards, and scenario comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you’ll do here\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load 02b outputs:** `R.npz` (csr), `R_mask.npz` (csr), `matrix_metadata.npz`, plus `lsoa_index`, `population` (aligned to rows), and `station_lsoas` (aligned to columns).\n",
    "- **Build coverage sets** once per threshold `T` via boolean CSR incidence `A_T = (R ≤ T)`.\n",
    "- **Solve MCLP** for a grid of `(T, p)` and report coverage KPIs vs the 02b baseline.\n",
    "- **Solve p-median** for a range of `p`, with optional **k-nearest** edge sparsification to keep the model lean.\n",
    "- **(Optional) Variants:**  \n",
    "  - **LSCP** (feasibility at `T`): minimal `p` so every LSOA is within `T`.  \n",
    "  - **Back-up MCLP**: enforce ≥2-deep cover for resilience.\n",
    "- **Export** selected sites, assignments, KPI deltas, and **map-ready** layers.\n",

    "- **Demand & weights:** `lsoa_index`, `population`\n",
    "- **Candidate sites:** `station_lsoas` (candidate set `J`)\n",
    "- **Parameters:**  \n",
    "  - Coverage thresholds: `T ∈ {7, 15, 18, 40}` (minutes)  \n",
    "  - Facility counts: `p` (e.g., `{6, 8, 10, 12, 14}`)  \n",
    "  - p-median sparsification: `k` (default `15`) and optional max radius (e.g., `60` min)\n",

    "- **p-median costs:** population-weighted mean minutes (overall + deciles)\n",
    "- **Assignments:** nearest chosen site per LSOA with travel time\n",
    "- **Top gains:** LSOAs with largest minutes saved vs baseline\n",
    "- **Map layers:** binary coverage (≤`T`) and “minutes to assigned station” rasters\n",
    "- **Chosen sites CSV:** station LSOA, selection flag, (optional) opening rank\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sanity checks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCLP monotonicity:** for fixed `T`, coverage must not decrease as `p` grows.  \n",
    "2. **Threshold monotonicity:** for fixed `p`, coverage must not decrease as `T` grows.  \n",
    "3. **LSCP feasibility:** report minimal `p` for feasibility at `T` (or minimal `T` for a given `p`).  \n",
    "4. **p-median extremes:** `p = |J|` → cost equals baseline nearest-open; `p = 1` → single medoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes aligned to your codebase\n",
    "\n",
    "- Re-use 02b paths: `MATRICES_DIR`, `TABLES_DIR`, `MAPS_DIR`; keep column names consistent (`resp_le_{T}`, `t_resp_min`, etc.).\n",
    "- Preserve index order for `station_lsoas` (02b emphasised index stability).\n",
    "- After choosing `x`, you can pass the selected columns back into **02b**’s scenario runner to recompute end-to-end KPIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** Start with **PuLP + CBC** (lightweight). For larger scales, switch to OR-Tools MIP or python-mip. Warm-start p-median from a greedy MCLP solution or k-medoids for faster convergence.\n"
