# Coverage metrics – how to read

• Response metrics estimate drive time from the nearest ambulance station to each LSOA centroid.
• Conveyance metrics estimate drive time from each LSOA centroid to the nearest acute hospital.
• Results are population-weighted: we report the % of people living in LSOAs that meet each threshold.
• These are geographic potential metrics (road-speed based), not operational performance.
• Use joint metrics (e.g., response ≤7 AND conveyance ≤45) to see geography that meets both.
